		<h1>What is our topic</h1>
		<p>The aim of our project is Raising awareness on the effects of the wealth gap on people's standards of living. We chose this area to research on because we want to understand the causes and consequences of wealth inequality, and also ways to reduce it. We were quite interested in economics so it is also a reason why we chose this topic. We also thought that since this wealth gap can be seen a lot where we live that it will be easier to gather information. And lastly, we also thought that this issue was really big as it could lead to various other issues. </p>

		<h1>Project Aim</h1>
		<p>
			<p>There is a wealth gap in basically every country, conveying that this is a global issue that affects people from all around the world. So our aim of the project is to know more about the inequality in different countries and how it affects them to then try and compare them. We also want to raise awareness of wealth inequality because it is a common worldwide issue.<br><br></p>
			<p>The global perspective of this project is to understand more about the issue of wealth inequality and how it affects the people. For this data we will be using information online by viewing multiple websites (all listed down below) and data/statistics found by other people and by experts in the field. The local perspective for this project is about the wealth inequality in Beijing. This information will also be gathered through online research. The personal perspective for our project is how it may have affected the us. This data will be gathered through online research and also interviews and surveys which we have created.</p>

		<h1>The Survey</h1>
		<div class="surveyDescription">
			<p>We started off by asking for age and their nationality. We did this so that we could compare the results for people with different ages and from different environments. We spread the survey by telling our friends to do it either by sending them it or by printing it out and letting them answer. We also asking them to help spread it on WeChat allowing us to get more responses. </p><br>
			<p>In general, most people believed that there is a wealth gap in China and that it’s a global issue which occurs in every country. Approximately 70% of the people said that that there is a large wealth gap in general and that there is a big wealth gap in China. </p><br>
			<p>For the causes, the majority (37%) thought that it was due to the lack of access to education. There were also quite a few people (around 24%) which thought that it was due to growth in technology. This is one of the answers we expected to be answered most as there is a low demand for the high supply of labour. </p><br>
			<p>For consequences, 50% answered that they thought that it will mainly stifle economic growth. It was the expected answer as prices are rising, valuable resource (food, clothes, electricity) are getting more expensive and the poor having less income and eventually no jobs not being able to afford it, resorting to possible crimes. Professional research in this field shows as the gap increases, crime also increases which can greatly affect businesses, communities, and overall economy. </p><br>
			<p>Overall, people’s backgrounds (native country/race) did not really affect the answers. We think that many people are aware of this situation and most of them had the same views. However, some people (especially younger people) are not aware of the situation. This is why our aim to raise awareness is important. Letting the young know the issue is very important since they are the future. </p>

		<h1>Group Member Credits</h1>
			<p>
				<p>The group members are Luis, Ethan, Guy, Kyle and Ray. At first, we didn’t have a group leader as we decided that we would vote for everything so that everyone can contribute and give their opinions. However, later Luis and Ethan became the leaders of the group since they made most of the decisions in the group and did the most work. We made it so that all of the group members contributed to practically all of our projects as we would help each other with everything so that we have more opinions and so that we can all be included. We also thought that working together would make things easier as working alone is usually harder and more time consuming. However, we all did have our main roles which they were in charge of. </p>
				<p>The survey was created by Luis. However, we all contributed giving ideas for questions and spreading the survey. For the outcomes, we did it more individually or in pairs as doing it together is harder. Luis and Ethan were in charge of creating the first website, Luis was in charge of the Video, and Guy and Luis were in charge of the poster. Luis and Ethan decided to sell the bracelets and Guy came up with the slogan on them. For the second website, due to internet connection problems, we couldn’t spread the work more evenly, so Luis was in charge of making it.
